        <p class="lead">
          Water Mitigation is the process of preventing or reducing the amount of water damage that happens after a wind
          storm to a roof, water damage to dwelling/contents from firemen caused by a firesomething like, a leaking pipe
          or e tc.a flooded basement. Water mitigation prevents any additional damage with fast and appropriate actions
          once we have completed your water damage restoration. This process includes:</br></br>

          <b>Assessment, Water Extraction, Cleaning, Sanitizing, Drying, Water Damage Repair, Water Damage Restoration
</b>
        </br></br>
          Water mitigation is often required after plumbing failures, floods, or water rushes into homes after a storm.
          Ceiling water damage, soaked rugs, ruined furniture, and warped flooring begin to occur if a water damage
          restoration team isn't on site quickly. We take specific steps to reduce property destruction, avoid any
          potential mold growth, and restore the property to its original value.

          <h5>Things to do when you detect water damage:</h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Stay calm. You need to be able to think clearly.</li>
            <li> Close down the water main. If your flood is related to appliances or pipes, shut down all sources of
              water to reduce damage.</li>
            <li> After that, shut down electrical breakers in the damaged areas. Make sure electricity is off before
              removing or unplugging any of the electrical equipment from the
              submerged areas or the wet carpet!</li>
            <li> Call us for water damage restoration.</li>
            <li> Remove fabrics, papers, books, potted plants, shoes and other items capable of staining the wet carpet.
            </li>
            <li> Mop and blot in order to remove as much water as you can.</li>
            <li> Remove the rugs and anything that is not permanently attached to the floor. Don't try to remove the
              wall-to-wall carpet.</li>
            <li> The curtains should be lifted from the floor. Loop them through a coat hanger. Place this hanger on the
              drapery rod.</li>
            <li> Take a cloth and wipe the furniture. Place the wet cushions in a dry place in order to allow even
              drying.
              Place an aluminum foil under the legs of the furniture.</li>
            <li> Move paintings, art, and photos to a dry and safe location.</li>
            <li> Open the drawers, cabinet doors, and closets in order to circulate air and enhance the drying.
            </li>

          <h5>Things to avoid when you detect water damage:</h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Avoid using the home vacuum. There is a risk of electrical shock, and there can be damage to the equipment
              as well. </li>
            <li> Avoid placing newspapers in the areas where you or other people will walk. The newspaper ink can
              quickly
              transfer to the wet fibers of the carpet and this can
              result in permanent staining. </li>
            <li> Don't</br>
              - Walk on the carpet except when necessary. This will keep the damage from spreading to the unaffected
              areas.</br>
              - Enter any room that has standing water. If you must enter a room with standing water, turn off the
              electricity to the house.</br>
              - Lift the tacked-down carpet without professional help.</br>
              - Use electrical appliances when you have wet floors or carpet.</br>
              - Remove books from the shelves.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Shop vacuums or the companies that only have carpet drying equipment can't prevent the water from damaging
            the
            walls, under molding or baseboards. The water penetrates through the floor coverings into the subfloors, and
            it eventually causes damage to the rooms located below.
            </br>
            If the building's internal moisture isn't controlled, the undamaged objects that are safe from original
            flood
            damage can get ruined because it is absorbing moisture from the air. The structures that are not dried fast
            or
            adequately enough will serve as food sources for mold. This will later lead to more expensive mold removal
            services.
